<i>
He is self-learned photographer. He educated himself of fine nuances of the art through books, workshops, practice and inspiration from seniors / ace photographers like  Sahil Fauzdar, Jasminder Oberoi.
Photography is like meditation for him and he loves going on early morning / late night shoots.

He says :-

“My first camera was a sony digital point & shoot which was gifted by brother as he saw my interest in photography from Barcelona, Spain in 2007, later I upgraded to Canon DSLR in 2015.

My favorite shooting time is morning twilight to sunrise and evening sunset time.

The beauty of this time is everything is at peace- people, city, traffic, birds, even the sky, all is just so beautiful and calm during these hours.”

“Acquiring expensive gear does not make one a better photographer, my first 4 years I used Canon Rebel T3i with EF-S 18-55 f3.5-5.6 lens that came as kit. All landscape images, portraits, macro, long exposure images were shot using this kit.”
